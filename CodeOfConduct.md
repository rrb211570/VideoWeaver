# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

In the spirit of creating a positive and productive environment, we pledge to:

    Affirm the presence of others, welcoming the viewpoints/experiences they hold
    Pursue mature and thoughtful communication, as befits a professional setting
    Gracefully accept constructive criticism
    Respect others' time by only asking questions when preliminary research using Google, Stack Overflow, and Reddit has not provided a sufficient answer

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    Public or private harassment
    Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
